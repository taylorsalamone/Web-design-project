    </div>

    <p1>At first, I had a bit of trouble coming up with an idea for my project pitch.<br/>
    But then I got to thinking...why don't I create a social media campaign for something that I am passionate about?<br/>
    The answer?</p>

    <h2>Boneless. Wings.</h2>
    <p>As of late there has been a fiery debate about whether boneless wings are chicken nuggets.<br/>
    As an avid boneless wing fan, I am proposing we settle this argument once and for all by <em>declaring</em> through a cohesive campaign that...</p>
    <p>boneless wings <strong>ARE NOT</strong> chicken nuggets!!!!</p>

    <h2>Why boneless wings?</h2>
      <div class="body image">
        <img src="boneless-wings.jpg" alt="boneless wings"
        style="width:400px;height:200px;"/>

    <p>Well, let me tell you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Boneless wings are fundamentally different than nugs and the world needs to see that!</li>
      <li>I personally love b-less wings and prefer them to ordinary wings</li>
      <li>I think creating a social media campaign for a lighthearted topic will be a fun experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What would the social media campaign consist of?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Facebook and Twitter cover photos and profile pics</li>
      <li>Ads/graphics promoting our stance for social media timelines</li>
      <li>Website to act as the hub for the campaign
          (people can go there for more detailed information)</li>
      <li>Short YouTube promotional video</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="footer">
    <span><b>So, if you think we are two birds of a feather then</b><br/><strong> JOIN ME </strong><b>in educating the world about chicken!</b></p>
