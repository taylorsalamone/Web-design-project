    <h1>My project pitch draft!</h1>
    <p>At first, I had a bit of trouble coming up with an idea for my project pitch.<br/>
    But then I got to thinking...why don't I create a social media campaign for something that I am passionate about?<br/>

    <p>As of late there has been a fiery debate about whether boneless wings are chicken nuggets.<br/>
    As an avid boneless wing fan, I am proposing we settle this argument once and for all by <em>declaring</em> through a cohesive campaign that...</p>
    <p>boneless wings <strong>ARE NOT</strong> chicken nuggets!!!!</p>
